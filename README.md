# Note App

**<p>In this project, I developed a note-taking application with HTML CSS and TypeScript. You can keep your notes as a record and update them later. With the authentication panel, each user's notes are stored in the local browser storage, so that even if they log in to the browser later, these data are not lost and they can return to the notes they saved. In this project, TypeScript Thanks to static type determination features, JavaScript code has been made more secure and scalable.</p>**
